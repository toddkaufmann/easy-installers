# easy-installers
Easy install scripts for rather complex sotware.

These can serve as a working HOWTO,
or give you a running start on an install.

For me it serves as a memory aid and reminder of what to do and what
to look for.

Everything downloads and installs to and under the current directory
where the script is run.
If it already exists then it won't be downloaded/installed again.


== Script(s) included:

=== install-tomcat7.sh

Download tomcat 7,
extract from archive,
create a user with manager-gui role (so you can manage from the web interface),
start the server,
check log for messages.
